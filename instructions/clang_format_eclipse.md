Install https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/cppstyle Plugin by dragging it into the eclipse workspace (not into the file editor window but into the project explorer window).


You will need to agree to some stuff nobody reads and then restart eclipse
Download this style sheet, i.e. store it to a local style.xml file, and move it into a folder where you won't delete anytime soon.
Open Eclipse Preferences (Window -> Preferences)
Search for "formatter"

Use the Import Button to find and import your downloaded style sheet.
Make sure the Active Profile Spinner says "Google C++"
Set the Code Formatter Spinner to CppStyle

Apply and close the window

Go over your files that you worked on and use Ctrl + Shift + F to format your code.
